Criteria
========
1. Peak power consumption 
    - provide adequate current source
    - choose the right voltage regulator
2. Spike protection - implement constraints
    - use thermistors or such to cutoff if spikes, and choose
    appropriate I_trip and I_hold.
3. Power sequencing
    - VDD_CORE and VDD_IO may have to come up at different times.

Peak power consumption
======================

AT91SAM9260 MCU has the following power requirements.
- VDD_CORE              1.8V
- VDD_BU (backup)       1.8V
- VDD_PLL               1.8V
- VDD_IOM (memory)      3.3V
- VDD_IOP0 (periph.)    3.3V
- VDD_IOP1 (periph.)    3.3V (1.8/2.5V)

IO Output Current

- PA0-PA31 PB0-PB31 PC0-PC3     16 mA
- PC4 - PC31 in 3.3V range      2 mA    (we use 3.3V)
- PC4 - PC31 in 1.8V range      4 mA

Without power consumption of IO and peripherals, 
the MCU consumes 130 mA. Operating the peripherals doesn't appear to need very
much more (USB is the max. with 500mA perhaps)

Calculate additional IO current consumption as per the table in spec.

Spike protection
================

Use thermistors to protect power supplies.
