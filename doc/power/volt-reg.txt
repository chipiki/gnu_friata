I am looking for a voltage regulator which replaces the LM1117 in the Olimex
schematic. LM1117 sources 800mA with 3.3V output from a 5V input. I am not sure
that this is sufficient given the processor, peripherals, USB and FXS module.
So, to be on the safe side, I want to source 1000mA (or 1A) to get an extra
200mA.

National Semiconductor and Failchild Semiconductor appear to offer similarly
priced alternatives.


National Semiconductor
======================

LM3940 - 3.3V/1A output with 5V input.

(appears to be a drop-in replacement for LM1117)
    
LP38960 - 3.3V/1A output with 5V input.
LP38690SD-3.3 (ordering info, to be precise)

Fairchild Semiconductor
=======================

FAN1117A - 3.3V/1A with 5V input (or is it 12V).
