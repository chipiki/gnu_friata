Capacitors are often recommended on input and output power pins.
The following must be taken into consideration.
1. Voltage rating
2. Temperature
3. Transient response to certain frequencies.
4. ESR < 300 m-ohm

Ceramic capacitors are always recommended with X5R or X7R temperature rating,
with additional aluminium electrolytic capacitors for transient response at
low freuencies (>= 100 uF)

Use tantalum/polarized capacitors for large capacitances simply because they
are cheaper and have a much smaller footprint. An equivalent non-polarized
capacitor would be expensive and have a very large footprint.

Polarized ceramic capacitors do not exist.

[3] Quoting from an online post:

The larger the capacitance of a capacitor, the less likely you'll find
anything but electrolytic and tantalum (and hence polarized capacitors)
because using other methods would result in non-polarized capacitors
which would result in capacitors that were physically way too large.

I can't think of a single application that would require one to specify
a polarized capacitor. The times they are specified, it's because that's
the cheapest/easiest way (or sometimes the only possible way) to get the
needed capacitance.

And of course, some applications don't do so well with polarized capacitors,
so at those times one has to go out of one's way to get a non-polarized
capacitor of the large enough capacitance, or use some workaround to
get the equivalent that is non-polarized.

Rarely will you come across a polarized capacitor in a circuit that can
more easily be found in a non-polarized capacitor, hence usually there
isn't a good reason to put in a non-polarized where a polarized capacitor
is specified. Doing such a substitution should not cause a problem,
other than higher cost and a physically larger capacitor.
