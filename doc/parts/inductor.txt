Low-Q ferrite beads used for DC supply filtering.

Noise is conducted from the DC power supply and GND lines to the switching
power supply and radiated out using the AC power supply cable as an antenna. 
To suppress the noise, the BLM--P series (Chip Ferrite Bead) and NFM--P series
(Chip EMIFILÂ® for DC power supply circuits) are installed close to the power
supply connector. A filter whose rated current is sufficiently larger than the
power supply current should be selected.
